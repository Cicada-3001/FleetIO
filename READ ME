Fleet Management System
This repository contains three branches for managing a fleet system consisting of server, client, and tracker applications. The server branch holds Express-MongoDB code, the client branch contains Android code connected to Firebase, and the tracker branch features Android code also connected to Firebase.

Branches:
Server: Contains Express-MongoDB code for the backend, providing endpoints for storing and retrieving data.
Client: Includes Android code for the client application, connected to Firebase. This application is part of the fleet management system.
Tracker: Comprises Android code for the tracker application, also connected to Firebase. This application simulates vehicle movement services, updating the Firebase Realtime Database with real-time location data.

Setup and Configuration:
Server:
Clone the repository and switch to the server branch.
Navigate to the server directory.
Install dependencies using npm install.
Configure your MongoDB connection in server.js.
Run the server using npm start.
Client:
Clone the repository and switch to the client branch.
Open the Android project in Android Studio located in the client directory.
Configure Firebase by adding google-services.json obtained from the Firebase console.
Build and run the Android application on your device or emulator.
Tracker:
Clone the repository and switch to the tracker branch.
Open the Android project in Android Studio located in the tracker directory.
Configure Firebase by adding google-services.json obtained from the Firebase console.
Build and run the Android application on your device or emulator.
Usage:
Server: Once the server is running, it provides endpoints for storing and retrieving data for the fleet management system.
Client: Use the client application for managing the fleet, accessing features such as vehicle tracking, scheduling, and reporting.
Tracker: Run the tracker application to simulate vehicle movement services, updating the Firebase Realtime Database with real-time location data.


Additional Notes:
Ensure proper network configuration and permissions for Firebase to function correctly.
For detailed documentation on server endpoints and client/tracker application functionalities, refer to the respective directories within this repository.
